#### The impacts of recreational marijuana legalization on adolescents
There are many arguments for and against the legalization of recreational marijuana. One argument against legalization is that marijuana use in teens will increase with marijuana becoming legal. While studies such as [this one](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33573728/) come to the conclusion that recreational marijuana legalization increases use in teens, other studies such as [this one](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33243722/) and [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2737637) refute those claims. 

Another common argument against RML is that marijuana could be a gateway drug that leads to abusing harder substances such as opioids and cocaine. Studies such as [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7359408/) claim that marijuana use, along with other genetic and environmental factors, increase the likeliness of opioid use disorder in the future. On the other hand, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/marijuana/faqs/does-marijuana-lead-to-other-drugs.html) claims that the majority of cannabis users do not go on to use harder substances. 

With many studies and sources contradicting each other, I plan to analyze multiple sources of data to determine if these claims against RML hold to be true. Responses from the [National Survey on Drug Use and Health](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health) (NSDUH) and data from the CDC's [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/results.htm) (YBRSS) can be used to answer the following questions.  
1. Does RML increase usage among teens?
2. Are the usage levels of opiates and cocaine (and other "hard" substances) greater in states that have legalized marijuana?

#### Data
NSDUH: Specifically I will be looking at estimated totals by state for the years between 2013-2019. Each "estimated totals" data set contains 33 sheets representing a different question from the survey. [This links](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/report/2018-2019-nsduh-estimated-totals-state) to one the data set for the 2019 responses. 

YRBSS: The YRBSS data contains survey responses from a wide range of questions. I will only be focused on the questions in the "Alcohol and Other Drug Use" category. I plan to look at the United States totals between 1991 and 2019 as well as individual states that have legalized marijuana recreationally. [This links](https://nccd.cdc.gov/Youthonline/App/Results.aspx?TT=J&OUT=0&SID=HS&QID=QQ&LID=XX&YID=YY&LID2=&YID2=&COL=T&ROW1=N&ROW2=N&HT=C03&LCT=LL&FS=S1&FR=R1&FG=G1&FA=A1&FI=I1&FP=P1&FSL=S1&FRL=R1&FGL=G1&FAL=A1&FIL=I1&FPL=P1&PV=&TST=False&C1=&C2=&QP=G&DP=1&VA=CI&CS=Y&SYID=1991&EYID=2019&SC=DEFAULT&SO=ASC) to the data set containing US data between 1991 and 2019. 

#### Ethics
There are important ethical considerations to take into account when analyzing such data. Most importantly, policy makers could potentially use these results when considering the possibility of federally legalizing recreational marijuana. Marijuana users, businesses in the legal industry, and the people who could benefit from potential tax gains would all be impacted by the legalization of marijuana.  

According to Tax Foundation, states with legal recreational marijuana earned between $20 million and one billion dollars in tax revenue in 2020 alone ([Christy Bieber](https://www.fool.com/research/marijuana-tax-revenue-by-state/#:~:text=That%20remains%20to%20be%20seen,revenue%20from%20recreational%20cannabis%20already.)). Estimates in other (non legal) states show that the government could potentially earn an additional $4.1 billion in tax revenue by legalizing recreational marijuana federally. 

While marijuana legalization would bring business to marijuana shop owners and increase tax revenue, there are other not so positive indirect impacts. Some [articles](https://www.narconon-warnersprings.org/blog/what-is-the-scope-of-marijuana-related-traffic-accidents.html) argue that RML leads to increased traffic accidents, which would potentially indirectly impact everyone on the road and their families.
